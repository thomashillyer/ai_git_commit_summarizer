# ChatGitPT : An AI LLM Git Commit Summarizer

Have you ever been looking through your git history and see all the useless commit messages like: "done", "small fix", "changes"? If you are looking for something specific they are useless! This project aims to summarize each commit and display it alongside the git tree so developers can quickly scan the list and find the actual commit they were looking for.

Currently:
ChatGPT prompt located in prompt.txt, paste into new chat at chat.openai.com. Then run this script on your desired repository and paste the output diff into the chat window.

Working on:
